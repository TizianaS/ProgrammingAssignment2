##makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
##cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix.

##The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", 
##which is really a list containing a function to
##set the value of the matrix
##get the value of the matrix
##set the value of the inverse
##get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)

}


##The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector" 
##created with the above function. 
##However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. 
##If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation.
##Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data 
##and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(m)
        m
